### About the project
 
This project for the Fullstack Javascript Module on The Odin Project is meant to display our knowledge of objects that was taught in the previous lessons.
The app allows users to create cards containing info on "books" they have read or want to read and displays them. Each "book" card has a toggle to switch
the read status from read to unread and a button to remove the card. User data is stored using local storage, so it can persist between sessions.

### Built With

* HTML
